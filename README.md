Licence snippets for Sublime Text
=================================

This package provides the text of several common open-source licences as
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) snippets. This makes it quick and
easy to insert licence text in your source files.

The licences are all taken from the
[OSI website](http://opensource.org/licenses/category).

Feel free to submit an
[issue](https://github.com/sijk/sublime-licence-snippets/issues/new)
or [pull request](https://github.com/sijk/sublime-licence-snippets/pulls)
if there's a licence you'd like added.


Installation
------------

The easiest and best way is to use
[Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).
Alternatively, you could clone this repository into your ST2 *Packages*
directory. But seriously, you should use Package Control.
