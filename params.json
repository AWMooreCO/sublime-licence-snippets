{"body":"This package provides the text of several common open-source licences as [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) snippets. It makes inserting licence text in your source files quick and easy. \r\n\r\nThe licences are all taken from the [OSI website](http://opensource.org/licenses/category).\r\n\r\nFeel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/sijk/sublime-licence-snippets/issues/new) or [pull request](https://github.com/sijk/sublime-licence-snippets/pulls) if there's a licence you'd like added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n##### Package Control\r\nThe easiest and best way to manage Sublime Text packages is with [Package Control][].\r\n\r\n1. Install [Package Control][] if you haven't already.\r\n2. Choose *Install Package* from the command palette.\r\n3. Select *Licence Snippets* and press Enter. Easy.\r\n\r\n[Package Control]: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control\r\n\r\n##### Git\r\n\r\nYou can clone [this repository](https://github.com/sijk/sublime-licence-snippets) into your Sublime Text *Packages* directory. You really should use Package Control, though.\r\n\r\n##### Zip\r\n\r\nYou can download a zip file from [here](https://github.com/sijk/sublime-licence-snippets/archive/master.zip) and extract it to your Sublime Text *Packages* directory. But seriously, just install Package Control.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo insert, for example, the MIT licence in a source file, open the command palette, type *mit* and choose *Licence Snippet: MIT* (or choose *Licence Snippet: MIT* from the snippets menu). The licence text will be inserted at the cursor. The copyright details (year, author, organization, etc.) will be highlighted in turn so that you can easily tab between them and modify them if necessary. \r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nTwo settings are available to configure the behaviour of this plugin. To set them, choose *Preferences > Settings - User* and add a line for the setting you want to change.\r\n\r\n- *licence_comment_style* = *none*, *line*, or *block* (default: *line*)\r\n- *licence_wrap_lines* = *True* or *False* (default: *False*)\r\n","tagline":"Open source licence snippets for Sublime Text 2","note":"Don't delete this file!
